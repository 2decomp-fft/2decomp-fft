fft_physical_z
------

This program can be used to test the fft trasform using Z as starting physical dimension. 
Both c2c and r2c/c2r transforms are testes.
The results should recover the input data up to machine accuracy
after a forward and a backward transform and proper normalisation.
The test automatically resize the problem depending on the number of MPI processes in use

What to expect:
- The timing results 
- The error reported should be around machine accuracy (~ 10^-6 for single
  precision and 10^-15 for double)
