# Summary

The 2DECOMP&FFT library is a software framework written in modern Fortran to build large-scale parallel applications. 
It is designed for applications using three-dimensional structured mesh and spatially implicit numerical algorithms. 
It is based on a general-purpose 2D pencil decomposition for data distribution and data Input Output (I/O). 
A 1D slab decomposition is also available as a special case of the 2D pencil decomposition.
The library includes a highly scalable and efficient interface to perform three-dimensional Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs). 
The library has been designed to be user-friendly, with a clean application programming interface 
hiding most communication details from application developers, and portable with support for modern CPUs 
and NVIDIA GPUs (support for AMD and Intel GPUs to follow).


# Statement of need

The 2DECOMP&FFT library [@li_2010_2decomp] is a software framework written in Fortran targeting 
large-scale parallel applications on structured meshes. 
It was originally designed for CPU hardware and is now used by many research groups worldwide. 
The library is based on a 2D-pencil decomposition for data distribution on distributed memory systems 
and is used as the core of many CFD solvers such as Xcompact3d [@BARTHOLOMEW2020100550] or CaNS [@COSTA20181853], 
with excellent strong scaling performance up to hundreds of thousands of CPU cores. 
2DECOMP&FFT mainly relies on MPI, and it offers a user-friendly interface that hides the complexity 
of the communication. 
The version 2.0 of the library offers also a 1D slab decomposition, which is implemented as a special case of the 
2D decomposition. Two alteratives are possible: 
- Initial slabs orientation in the `XY` plane 
- Initial slabs orientation in the `XZ` plane
In many configurations the slabs decompostion gives some gain in performances with respect to the 
2D  pencil decomposion. This is a consequence of having data already in memory when transposing between 
the two dimensions of the slab. Therefore, it is possible to perfor a simple memory copy between 
input and output arrays instead of the full MPI communication.

The library also offers also a very efficient and flexible 3D tool to perform 
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for distrubuted memory systems. However, 2DECOMP&FFT is mainly designed to perform 
management and communication and the actual computation of the 1D FFT is delegated to 3rd-parly libraries. 
The supported FFT backends are: FFTW [@FFTW05], the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL) and the CUDA FFT (cuFFT) 
which is used for FFT on NVIDIA GPUs. A Generic FFT backend, based on the 
Glassman's general N Fast Fourier Transform [@FERGUSON1982401], 
is also available to make the library more portable.   

While 2DECOMP&FFT library has been design with high order compact schemes in mind, it is possible 
that some derivatives can be evaluated using explicit formulation using local stencils. For this reason a 
halo support API is also provided to support explicit message passing between neighbouring pencils. 

Finally the library provide an infrastucture to perfrom data I/O using MPI I/O or ADIOS2 [@godoy2020adios]. 
The API provide several features such as: write of a single or multiple 3D arrays into a file, write of 2D slices 
from a 2D array, write of the results using a lower precision (i.e. double precision into single) 
and with lower resolution. 

The first version of the library was released in 2010 as a tar.gz package, with a Makefile approach, 
and could only make use of CPUs. It has not been modified since its release. 
The new version of the library can now leverage NVIDIA GPUs, modern CPUs and various compilers 
(GNU, Intel, NVHPC, CRAY). 
It has CMAKE capabilities as well as a proper continuous integration framework with automated tests. 
The new library was designed to be more appealing to the scientific community,  
and can now be easily implemented as an independent library for use by other software. 

# Acknowledgements

The first version of the library was initially designed thanks to several projects funded under the 
HECToR Distributed Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Service operated by NAG Ltd. 
The new library has been designed thanks to the support of EPSRC via the CCP Turbulence (EP/T026170/1).
