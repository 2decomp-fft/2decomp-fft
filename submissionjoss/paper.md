# Summary

The 2DECOMP&FFT library is a software framework written in modern Fortran 
to build large-scale parallel applications. 
It is designed for applications using three-dimensional structured mesh 
and spatially implicit numerical algorithms. At the foundation it implements 
a general-purpose 2D pencil decomposition for data distribution. 
On top it provides a highly scalable and efficient interface to 
perform three-dimensional distributed Fast Fourier Transforms. 


# Statement of need

The 2DECOMP&FFT library li_2010_2decomp is a software framework written 
in Fortran targeting large-scale 
parallel applications. 
The library is based on a 2D-pencil decomposition for data distribution 
on distributed memory systems. The library is at the core of many CFD solver such as 
Xcompact3d BARTHOLOMEW2020100550, 
where it has been shown to scale up to hundreds of thousands of cores. 
2DECOMP&FFT mainly relies on MPI, but it offers a user-friendly 
interface that hides the complexity of the communication. 
Indeed, the library offers also a very efficient and flexible 3D tool 
to perform Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) that also 
exposes other popular FFT libraries like FFTW. 

# Acknowledgements

The library was initially designed thanks to several projects funded under the 
HECToR Distributed Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) Service operated by NAG Ltd. 
The new library has been designed thanks to the support of EPSRC via the CCP Turbulence (EP/T026170/1).
