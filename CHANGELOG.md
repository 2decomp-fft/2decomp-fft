# Changelog

This file tracks the notable changes to the 2decomp&fft project (starting from v2.0).

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

When a release is made the "Unreleased" section should be renamed to that version and date
_e.g._ vX.Y - YYYY-MM-DD and a new "Unreleased" section started above.

## Unreleased
