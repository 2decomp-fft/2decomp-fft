# 2decomp-fft

## Building

Different compilers can be set by specifying `CMP`, e.g. `make CMP=intel`
to build with Intel compilers, see `Makefile` for options.

By default an optimised library will be built, debugging versions of the
library can be built with `make BUILD=debug`, a development version which 
additionally sets compile time flags to catch coding errors can be built 
with `make BUILD=dev` (GNU compilers only currently). The behavior of debug
and development versions of the library can be changed before the initialization
using the variable ``decomp_debug`` or the environment variable ``DECOMP_2D_DEBUG``.
The value provided with the environment variable must be a positive integer below 9999.

On each build of the library (`make`, `make all`) a temporary file `Makefile.settings` with
all current options (`FFLAGS`, `DEFS`, etc.) will be created, and included
on subsequent invocations, the user therefore does not need to keep
specifying options between builds.

To perform a clean build run `make clean` first, this will delete all
output files, including `Makefile.settings`.

## Testing and examples

Various example code to exercise 2decomp functionality can be found under ``examples/``
and can be built from the top-level directory by executing
```
make check
```
which will (re)build 2decomp&fft as necessary.

By default this will run the tests/examples on a single rank, launched with ``mpirun``.
The number of ranks can be controlled by setting the ``NP`` variable and the launcher is overridden by
setting ``MPIRUN``, for example to run tests on 4 ranks using an ``mpiexec`` launcher installed at
``${HOME}/bin/mpiexec`` the command would be
```
make NP=4 MPIRUN=${HOME}/bin/mpiexec check
```

## GPU compilation

The library can perform multi GPU offoloading using the NVHPC compiler suite for NVIDIA hardware. 
The implementation is based on CUDA-aware MPI and NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL).
The FFT is based on cuFFT. 
To compile the library for GPU it is possible to execute the following
```
make CMP=nvhpc FFT=cufft PARAMOD=gpu CUFFT_PATH=PATH_TO_NVHPC/Vers/Linux_x86_64/Vers/compilers/ 
``` 
The `Makefile` will look for the relative libraries (NVCC, cuFFT, etc) under the `${CUFFT_PATH}/include`
NCCL is not activated by default. If NCCL is installed/required use `NCCL=yes`. 
The current implementation relays also on opeanACC
and on automatic optimization of `do concurrent` loops.
By default the compute architecture for the GPU is 80 (i.e. Ampere), to change it use `CCXY=XY` 
 
## Profiling

Profiling can be activated in the Makefile. Set the variable `PROFILER` to one of the supported profilers (only `caliper` currently). If using `caliper`, provide the installation path in the variable `CALIPER_PATH`. When the profiling is active, one can tune it before calling `decomp_2d_init` using the subroutine `decomp_profiler_prep`. The input argument for this subroutine is a logical array of size 4. Each input allow activation / deactivation of the profiling as follows :

1. Profile transpose operations (default : true)
2. Profile IO operations (default : true))
3. Profile FFT operations (default : true)
4. Profile decomp_2d init / fin subroutines (default : true)

## Miscellaneous

### Print the log to a file or to stdout

Before calling `decomp_2d_init`, the external code can modify the variable `decomp_log` to change the output for the log. The expected value is defined by the integer constants
```
integer, parameter, public :: D2D_LOG_QUIET = 0       ! No logging output
integer, parameter, public :: D2D_LOG_STDOUT = 1      ! Root rank logs output to stdout
integer, parameter, public :: D2D_LOG_TOFILE = 2      ! Root rank logs output to the file "decomp_2d_setup.log"
integer, parameter, public :: D2D_LOG_TOFILE_FULL = 3 ! All ranks log output to a dedicated file
```
exported by the `decomp_2d` module.
Although their values are shown here, users should not rely on these and are recommended to prefer to use the named variables `D2D_LOG_QUIET`, etc. instead.
The default value used is `D2D_LOG_TOFILE` for the default build and `D2D_LOG_TOFILE_FULL` for a debug build.

### Change the debug level for debug builds

Before calling `decomp_2d_init`, the external code can modify the variable `decomp_debug` to change the debug level. The user can also modify this variable using the environment variable `DECOMP_2D_DEBUG`. Please note that the environment variable is processed only for debug builds. The expected value for the variable `decomp_debug` is some integer between 0 and 6, bounds included.

## Optional dependencies

### FFTW

The library [fftw](http://www.fftw.org/index.html) can be used as a backend for the FFT engine. The version 3.3.10 was tested, is supported and can be downloaded [here](http://www.fftw.org/download.html). Please note that one should build fftw and decomp2d against the same compilers. For build instructions, please check [here](http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Installation-on-Unix.html). Below is a suggestion for the compilation of the library in double precision (add `--enable-single` for a single precision build):

```
wget http://www.fftw.org/fftw-3.3.10.tar.gz
tar xzf fftw-3.3.10.tar.gz
mkdir fftw-3.3.10_tmp && cd fftw-3.3.10_tmp
../fftw-3.3.10/configure --prefix=xxxxxxx/fftw3/fftw-3.3.10_bld --enable-shared
make -j
make -j check
make install
```

### Caliper

The library [caliper](https://github.com/LLNL/Caliper) can be used to profile the execution of the code. The version 2.9.0 was tested and is supported, version 2.8.0 has also been tested and is still expected to work. Please note that one must build caliper and decomp2d against the same C/C++/Fortran compilers and MPI libray. For build instructions, please check [here](https://github.com/LLNL/Caliper#building-and-installing) and [here](https://software.llnl.gov/Caliper/CaliperBasics.html#build-and-install). Below is a suggestion for the compilation of the library using the GNU compilers:

```
git clone https://github.com/LLNL/Caliper.git caliper_github
cd caliper_github
git checkout v2.9.0
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../../caliper_build_2.9.0 -DWITH_FORTRAN=yes -DWITH_MPI=yes -DBUILD_TESTING=yes ../
make -j
make test
make install
```
