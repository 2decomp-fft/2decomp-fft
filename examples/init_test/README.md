init_test
---------

This example demonstrates the initialisation of DECOMP2D&FFT library and tests 
that the size of the mesh in every direction is the expected

What to input: The program takes max 5 inputs as : 
               1) p_row [optional]
	       2) p_col [optional] 
	       3) nx    [optional]
	       4) ny    [optional]
	       5) nz    [optional]
	       In case the decomposition is imposed both (1) and (2) are necessary. 
	       If also the resolution is imposed (1-5) are necessary

What to expect: Success/error message if initialization process has been complted or 
                errors have been encountered.
